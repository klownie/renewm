**renewm** is a Wayland compositor written with laptops and touchpads in mind. The idea is, instead of placing windows inside the small viewport (that is, the monitor) to arrange them along an arbitrarily large two-dimensional wall (generally without windows overlapping) and focus the compositors job on moving around along this wall efficiently and providing ways to the user to rearrange the wall such that they find the overall layout intuitive.

# Important Notice

Please be aware that this project is solely a personal side project undertaken to learn Rust programming. For a more stable and professionally maintained repository, I highly recommend using newm-atha. You can find it at the following link: [newm-atha](https://git.sr.ht/~atha/newm-atha).
